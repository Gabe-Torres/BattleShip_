<p> 
This is a terminal Ruby game that uses an algorithm to render Battleship, a classic board game where players place one or more ships on a grid board. Players then take turns trying to 'sink' the other playerâ€™s ships by guessing their coordinates. The game ends when one player's ships are all hit and 'sunk'.
